# UD120-finalproject
The final project for the Udacity Machine Learning course.

I started with an exploratory data analysis to get a feeling for what the features were and the nature of the data.

### Data prep

### ML Models
I experimented with a few different machine learning models in using the sci-kit learn package. In each case I would get the model running and then try to tune the parameters to improve performance. Here is a quick summary of the performance I was able to achieve with each model.

| Naive Bayes   |               |
| ------------- | -------------:|
| Precision     | 0.412         |
| Recall        | 0.389         |
| F1            | 0.400         | 
| MCC           | 0.XXX         |

| SVM           |               |
| ------------- | -------------:|
| Precision     | 0.250         |
| Recall        | 0.389         |
| F1            | 0.304         | 
| MCC           | 0.XXX         |

| KNN           | 3-folds       | 4-folds       |
| ------------- | -------------:| -------------:|
| Precision     | 0.455         | 0.357         |
| Recall        | 0.278         | 0.278         |
| F1            | 0.345         | 0.313         |
| MCC           | 0.XXX         | 0.XXX         |

| DT            |               |
| ------------- | -------------:|
| Precision     | 0.385         |
| Recall        | 0.556         |
| F1            | 0.455         | 
| MCC           | 0.XXX         |

| RF            |               |

| F1            | 0.348         | 
| MCC           | 0.XXX         |

| AdaBoost      |               |
| ------------- | -------------:|
| Precision     | 0.583         |
| Recall        | 0.389         |
| F1            | 0.467         |
